        <p>I think I’d separate those obsessed with luxury watches into two categories. One of which are filled with watch enthusiasts who aspire to own great watches one day or already own one. The rest are those who do not fully appreciate these great watches and simply buy them as a status symbol. To each their own.

          I cannot speak for the latter, but being part of the former, I am quite intrigued by high-end luxury watches because I find them to be incredibly beautiful and aspire to own one in hopes of keeping it in good hands forever (for instance, I have a friend who received a vintage Rolex from his grandfather - how awesome would that be?). At the end of the day, for me and many others, luxury watches are simply well made and beautiful, significantly more so than the rest.
          
          As to the latter, well I hope they really enjoy that $10K watch they splurged on once they got their bonus.</p>

        <p>From the very beginning of civilization, humans have had an innate need to collect things. It may have been borne, as many things are, out of necessity back when we were hunters and gatherers. There were no stores, and so when you found food, you had to hoard it. Eventually as we became more industrialized as a species, we no longer needed to do this, but that desire to hunt, gather, and hoard has never gone away. This is why the modern day version of our primal instincts is to spend hours on Chrono24 searching for a very specific dial variant of a watch that serves no purpose, cutting a deal, figuring out how to minimize sales tax, and then rinsing and repeating as soon as the watch has arrived at our doorstep. Whether it is watches, art, sneakers, nail clippings or now jpegs on the blockchain (shout out NFT Crypto Goatz), we just cannot shake that inner need to collect things. It’s strange that we feel such pride from owning things that generally serve no purpose whatsoever</p>
